### Anna Petelin

Hi! I am a fullstack developer at Exove. I graduated from the Fullstack program at Helsinki Business College in 2023 and completed the H2C program at KAMK in 2021. At the moment my work is focused on web apps and APIs built using JavaScript, Typescript and ReactJS. In the past I have dabbled a little in python, C, and programming for IoT microdevices.
