### Anna Petelin

Hi! I am studying the Fullstack program at Helsinki Business College since Autumn 2022. At the moment my coursework is focused on web apps built using vanilla JavaScript. One day I will also be fluent in React, as well as SQL and server-side processing with Node.js. In the past I have dabbled in python, C, and programming for IoT microdevices. I am looking for internships!
